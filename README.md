Currently very limited but planning to add more features soon.

* Simple console interface to choose how my images to download.
* Automatically creates download folder (if not already present).
* Checks if the post has a 'file url' to get the original quality.
* Downloads next file if not.
* Fast.
* Rusty.


### Todo
- [ ] Allow custom download directory.
- [ ] Allow custom tags.
- [ ] More refined TUI.
- [ ] Doing my laundry.
- [ ] Build a frontend viewer.

Again. Would have been a pain without himeka's work. Tyvm whoever you are!
