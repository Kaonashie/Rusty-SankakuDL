Currently very limited but planning to add more features soon.

* Simple console interface to choose how my images to download.
* Automatically creates download folder (if not already present).
* Checks if the post has a 'file url' to get the original quality.
* Downloads next file if not.
* Fast.
* Rusty.

### Todo

* [x] Upgrade to a better http client.
* [ ] OMG ADD COMMENTS!
* [x] Add async abilities to speed up the download.
* [ ] Actually use the async abilities
* [ ] Allow custom download directory.
* [ ] Allow custom tags.
* [ ] First release.
* [ ] More refined TUI.
* [x] Create an API backend for fetching with js libraries.
* [ ] Doing my laundry.
* [ ] Build a frontend viewer.

Again. Would have been a pain without himeka's work. Tyvm whoever you are!
